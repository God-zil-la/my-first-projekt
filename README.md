Deployment

This website can be deployed both locally for testing and online for broader accessibility. Below are the steps to set up and deploy the site efficiently.

Local Deployment:

Download or Clone the Repository:

Use Git to clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/God-zil-la/3d-printing-website.git](https://github.com/God-zil-la/my-first-projekt.git)

Alternatively, download the project as a ZIP file and extract it.

Open the Project Files:

Navigate to the project folder.

Open index.html in a browser to test locally.

Ensure File Linking:

Make sure the index.css and script.js files are correctly linked in index.html.

Check that images are in the appropriate directory.

Run a Local Server (Optional):

You can start a simple local web server for testing:

python3 -m http.server 8000

Open http://localhost:8000/ in your browser.

Web Deployment:

The website can be deployed using various hosting platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

Deploying on GitHub Pages:

Push the project to a GitHub repository:

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main

Go to your repository settings on GitHub.

Scroll to the GitHub Pages section and select the main branch as the source.

The site will be hosted at https://God-zil-la.github.io/3d-printing-website/.

Deploying on Netlify:

Sign in to Netlify and click New site from Git.

Select your GitHub repository and configure build settings (no build command required for a static site).

Click Deploy, and Netlify will assign a public URL.

Deploying on Vercel:

Sign in to Vercel and create a new project.

Import the GitHub repository.

Configure deployment settings and click Deploy.

The project will be live with a Vercel-assigned URL or a custom domain.

Post-Deployment Checklist:

✔ Ensure all internal links are working.
✔ Verify that the contact form submits correctly.
✔ Test the responsiveness on different devices.
✔ Optimize performance for fast loading speeds.
✔ Set up analytics if needed (Google Analytics, etc.).

By following these steps, the 3D-printing website will be successfully deployed and accessible online for users worldwide.

Clone the repository or download the source files.

Open index.html in a browser.

Ensure all CSS and JavaScript files are properly linked.

Web Deployment:

Upload the index.html, index.css, and script.js files to a web hosting service like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

Ensure all images and assets are in the correct directories.

Configure domain settings if necessary and test the site.
